Description: DSS is an R library performing differntial analysis for
        count-based sequencing data. It detectes differentially
        expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq, and differentially
        methylated loci or regions (DML/DMRs) from bisulfite sequencing
        (BS-seq). The core of DSS is a new dispersion shrinkage method
        for estimating the dispersion parameter from Gamma-Poisson or
        Beta-Binomial distributions.
